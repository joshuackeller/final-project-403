        <p>I have been blessed to live in a family that cooks delicious meals every day. 
            When I moved to college I learned that if I wanted to eat good and not break the bank I neeeded to cook for myself
            I noticed that my roommates did not have healthy diets and they always expressed how they never had time to cook and 
            that they could not afford to eat to go food that was healthy.
